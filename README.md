This alternate form of governance voting is designed to mitigate many of the shortcomings of the current "1 token, 1 vote, >50% wins" status quo for decentralized governance:
1. Spamming the mechanism with fake projects
2. Scammers claiming to represent legitimate projects
3. Projects bribing voters to vote for projects in excess of their true value
4. Winning projects using their reputation to vote themselves up
5. Winning projects colluding to claim a larger share of CLNY
6. Voter apathy
7. Cognitive biases of various kinds, like the Keynesian Beauty Contest
8. Voters voting dishonestly or randomly
9. Sybil attacks of any sort (either among voters or projects)
